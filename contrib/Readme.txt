In this folder there should be 2 more folders named "include" and "lib" that
contains all the files used to communicate with the camera.

For licensing reason, we can't include those files but they are freely
downloadable (previous free registration) from this page: 
http://www.teledynedalsa.com/mv/products/cameradetail.aspx?partNumber=SG-14-01K40

In the "include" folder you must put all the .h files contained in the
"Dalsa SDK/Includes" folder of the "QuickCam 2.0" software and all the
.h files contained in "Spyder3 Application Guide, Library and DLL".

In the "lib" folder you must put all the .lib and .dll files contained in the
"Dalsa SDK/Libraries" folder of the "QuickCam 2.0" software and all the .lib
and .dll files contained in "Spyder3 Application Guide, Library and DLL".

The repo is configured to automatically ignore those folders since you need it
to use the program but you can't redistribute them.

Sorry for this.

Sincerely,
DRD Software
