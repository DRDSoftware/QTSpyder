WARNING: "Spyder3DLL.dll" have a compilation error that will make the project
         impossible to compile. It was compiled with Visual Studio 2005 and the
         linker considered the int type equal to the long type; therefore the
         decorated names of some of the functions have a "K" instead of an "I".
         We can't redistribute an edited version of this file for copyright reasons.
         Sorry. Anyway, if you want to modify the DLL, read the DLL_fix.txt
